# QUINTUM Core

QUINTUM is an independent proof-of-work cryptocurrency and peer-to-peer network being built from the ground up in modern C++23.

> Status: **pre-alpha / protocol design**. No mainnet exists yet. Coins created in development networks have no monetary value.

## Principles

- Independent network and genesis block
- Proof of Work
- UTXO accounting model
- Fully validating nodes
- Peer-to-peer block and transaction relay
- No premine, hidden mint, master key, or developer backdoor
- Private keys remain under the user's control
- Windows-first desktop experience, with portable core architecture
- Consensus rules are documented and tested before mainnet launch

## Technology

- C++23
- CMake
- secp256k1 for transaction signatures
- SHA-256 family cryptographic hashing
- LevelDB-class chainstate storage
- SQLite-class wallet metadata storage
- Qt 6 desktop wallet planned after the node and network are stable

## Repository map

- `src/` — node/core source code
- `docs/` — protocol and architecture documentation
- `docs/ru/START_HERE.md` — plain-language Russian project guide
- `.github/workflows/` — reproducible CI builds

## Development rule

Consensus-critical constants are **DRAFT** until the genesis block and mainnet specification are deliberately frozen. After mainnet launch, incompatible consensus changes require explicit network-upgrade rules.

## Current milestone

**M0 — Foundation:** build system, documentation, protocol decisions, deterministic tests.

Next: primitive types → serialization → hashing → transactions → UTXO → blocks → chainstate → PoW → genesis → P2P.
